# The **`prompt_parser.py`** file defines the `PromptParser` class, which is a relatively simple module that leverages the **`DependencyParser`** to analyze text prompts.

### **Key Components of `prompt_parser.py`**

#### 1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method):**
   - The `PromptParser` class is initialized with a dependency system, either Universal Dependencies (UD) or Stanford Dependencies, just like the `DependencyParser`.
   - Upon initialization, it creates an instance of the `DependencyParser` and logs the chosen system.

   ```python
   class PromptParser:
       def __init__(self, system='UD'):
           self.dependency_parser = DependencyParser(system=system)
           logging.info(f"PromptParser initialized with DependencyParser system: {system}")
   ```

#### 2. **`parse_prompt` Method:**
   - This method takes a text prompt as input and uses the `DependencyParser` to extract and analyze the syntactic dependencies.
   - It logs the parsing process and returns the list of parsed relationships (e.g., subject, object, modifiers) from the `DependencyParser`.

   ```python
   def parse_prompt(self, prompt):
       logging.info("Parsowanie promptu za pomocÄ… DependencyParser...")
       parsed_relations = self.dependency_parser.parse(prompt)
       logging.info(f"Parsed relations: {parsed_relations}")
       return parsed_relations
   ```

#### 3. **Integration with `DependencyParser`:**
   - The `PromptParser` is primarily a wrapper around the `DependencyParser`. It doesn't perform much independent work beyond delegating the text analysis to the underlying `DependencyParser` class, which does the heavy lifting of parsing and mapping linguistic relationships.

### **Logging:**
   - The module makes use of logging to track the entire process, from initialization to the actual parsing of the prompt. This logging provides useful insight into how the parsing process unfolds, which is particularly helpful for debugging.

### **Future Enhancements:**
   The docstring mentions possible future improvements, including:
   - Adding more advanced methods for prompt analysis.
   - Integrating with additional NLP tools to extend its functionality beyond dependency parsing.

### **Summary:**
`PromptParser` serves as a higher-level interface for prompt analysis. It simplifies the process by abstracting the use of the `DependencyParser` and provides a straightforward way to parse prompts and extract syntactic dependencies. This component will likely be used in the larger application to interpret user input (prompts) and analyze the relationships between words.
