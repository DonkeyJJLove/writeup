# The **`synapse_language.py`** file defines the `SynapseLanguage` class, which is responsible for creating and managing rules that represent synaptic relationships between parts of speech. These rules are used to model how words (or tokens) in a sentence relate to each other, based on their syntactic roles.

### **Key Components of `synapse_language.py`**

#### 1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method):**
   - The `SynapseLanguage` class is initialized with an empty list of rules and an optional `alphabet` (list of parts of speech used in the rules).
   - The default synaptic rules are defined at initialization by calling the `define_default_rules()` method.

   ```python
   class SynapseLanguage:
       def __init__(self):
           self.rules = []
           self.alphabet = []  # Optional: parts of speech used in the rules
           self.define_default_rules()
   ```

#### 2. **Adding Synaptic Rules (`add_rule` Method):**
   - This method allows the addition of a new synaptic rule, represented as a dictionary. The rule connects a source part of speech (`source_pos`) with a target part of speech (`target_pos`) through a specific relationship type (`type`).
   - The method also tracks parts of speech used in the `alphabet` list for further reference.

   ```python
   def add_rule(self, rule):
       """ Adds a synaptic rule connecting source_pos and target_pos with a specified type. """
       self.rules.append(rule)
       if rule['source_pos'] not in self.alphabet:
           self.alphabet.append(rule['source_pos'])
       if rule['target_pos'] not in self.alphabet:
           self.alphabet.append(rule['target_pos'])
       logging.info(f"Regu≈Ça synaptyczna dodana: {rule}")
   ```

#### 3. **Defining Default Rules (`define_default_rules` Method):**
   - This method defines a set of default synaptic rules that describe basic linguistic relationships. These include:
     - **Noun-Verb** associations (e.g., subjects and objects),
     - **Adjective-Noun** relationships (e.g., adjective modifiers),
     - **Prepositional-Noun** dependencies (e.g., prepositional phrases),
     - Additional linguistic dependencies like conjunctions, punctuation, and discourse elements.

   Example of some of the default rules:

   ```python
   self.add_rule({'source_pos': 'NOUN', 'target_pos': 'VERB', 'type': 'association'})
   self.add_rule({'source_pos': 'ADJ', 'target_pos': 'NOUN', 'type': 'adjective modifier'})
   self.add_rule({'source_pos': 'VERB', 'target_pos': 'NOUN', 'type': 'object'})
   ```

   The method logs the successful definition of default rules.

#### 4. **Rule Expansion and Future Enhancements:**
   The docstring suggests potential future expansions:
   - **Dynamic Rule Generation**: This would allow the system to generate rules dynamically based on data analysis.
   - **Machine Learning Integration**: Future versions of the class could automatically create rules using machine learning models.

### **Logging:**
   - The class makes extensive use of logging to track when rules are added and when the default set of rules has been defined. This is helpful for debugging and understanding the application's flow.

### **Summary:**
The `SynapseLanguage` class plays a critical role in defining how different parts of speech in a sentence can relate to each other through predefined rules. These rules act like synaptic connections between neurons, but in the linguistic context, they connect words based on syntactic and grammatical relationships. This class helps to formalize and manage these relationships in a way that the broader **SynapticVisualizationApp** can use for visualizing and analyzing the structure of natural language.
