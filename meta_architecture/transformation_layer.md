# The **`transformation_layer.py`** file plays a key role in converting the linguistic analysis of a prompt (produced by `PromptParser` and `DependencyParser`) into a neural structure consisting of **neurons** and **synapses**. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and how it ties together with other components:

### **Key Components of `transformation_layer.py`**

#### 1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method):**
   - The `TransformationLayer` class is initialized with a **`synapse_language`** instance, which likely defines the rules for how synapses (connections) should be structured between neurons (words).
   - It also initializes two primary data structures:
     - **`neurons`**: A dictionary mapping words to `Neuron` objects.
     - **`synapses`**: A list that stores `Synapse` objects representing relationships between neurons (words).

   ```python
   class TransformationLayer:
       def __init__(self, synapse_language):
           self.synapse_language = synapse_language
           self.neurons = {}  # Maps words to Neuron objects
           self.synapses = []  # Stores Synapse objects
           logging.info("TransformationLayer initialized.")
   ```

#### 2. **Transformation Process (`transform` Method):**
   - The `transform` method takes a parsed **analysis** (likely output from `PromptParser` or `DependencyParser`) and converts it into neurons and synapses.
   - The **analysis** parameter is a dictionary that contains:
     - **`units`**: These represent individual words in the sentence along with their part of speech (POS).
     - **`relations`**: These are the dependencies or relationships between words (e.g., subject, object, modifiers).

   ```python
   def transform(self, analysis):
       """Transforms the analysis of the prompt into neurons and synapses."""
   ```

   - **Neuron Creation**:
     For each word in the analysis, the method checks if the word is already represented as a neuron. If not, it creates a new `Neuron` object for the word and adds it to the `neurons` dictionary.

     ```python
     for unit in analysis['units']:
         word = unit['word']
         pos = unit['pos']
         if word not in self.neurons:
             self.neurons[word] = Neuron(name=word, pos=pos)
             logging.info(f"Neuron utworzony: {word} ({pos})")
     ```

   - **Synapse Creation**:
     For each relationship in the analysis, the method creates a **`Synapse`** object that links two neurons (words) based on the dependency. It retrieves the "child" and "parent" words (the related words) and the type of the relationship (dependency type).

     ```python
     for relation in analysis['relations']:
         child_word = relation['word']
         parent_word = relation['head']
         syn_type = relation['dependency']
     ```

     If both the child and parent words are represented as neurons, it creates a synaptic connection between them, using the **synapse type** from the analysis. If not, it logs a warning.

     ```python
     if child_word in self.neurons and parent_word in self.neurons:
         synapse = Synapse(
             source=self.neurons[parent_word],
             target=self.neurons[child_word],
             type=syn_type
         )
         self.synapses.append(synapse)
         logging.info(f"Synapsa utworzona: {parent_word} -> {child_word} ({syn_type})")
     else:
         logging.warning(f"Brak neuronu dla słowa: {child_word} lub {parent_word}")
     ```

#### 3. **Logging:**
   - The method logs the creation of neurons and synapses, as well as any missing neurons, providing transparency into the transformation process.
   - After transformation, it logs the total number of neurons and synapses created.

   ```python
   logging.info(f"Przekształcona analiza: {len(self.neurons)} neuronów, {len(self.synapses)} synaps")
   ```

### **Summary of Interactions:**
- **Input**: The `TransformationLayer` takes the output from the **`DependencyParser`** (or a similar component) as input, where the input contains words and their grammatical relationships.
- **Neurons**: It converts each word into a **Neuron** object, which holds information about the word and its part of speech.
- **Synapses**: It uses the relationships between words to create **Synapse** objects, representing the connections between neurons.
- **SynapseLanguage Integration**: While not directly used in this file, the **`synapse_language`** passed during initialization likely governs the types of synapses (relationships) allowed between neurons. This could be linked to the visualizations in the `neuron_visualizer.py`.

### **Overall System Flow:**
1. **Prompt Input**: User enters a prompt that gets parsed by the **`PromptParser`** and **`DependencyParser`**.
2. **Analysis**: The prompt is analyzed to extract syntactic relationships (e.g., subjects, objects, modifiers).
3. **Transformation**: The **`TransformationLayer`** converts these relationships into neurons and synapses based on predefined rules from **`SynapseLanguage`**.
4. **Visualization**: The **`NeuronVisualizer`** takes these neurons and synapses and creates a visual representation, using colors and labels to show the relationships.
